# Oleg Korol's Blog

Welcome to my blog!

```typescript filename="index.ts"
console.log('Hello, world!');
```

This blog serves two purposes:

1. Share my **experiences** and **thoughts** on software development and other topics.
2. Serve as a place to collect my **short notes**, **TILs** and other stuff, for later reference.

I hope you find something useful for yourself.
