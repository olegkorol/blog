This is just a reference post to see how we can use the pgn-viewer component in my blog.

Here are a few boards using pgn-viewer (all view-only for the blog).

### 1. Opening position

Plain starting position. No extra config.

<Chessboard />

### 2. After 1.e4

A specific FEN.

<Chessboard position="rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3 0 1" />

### 3. Black's perspective

Same position as above but with black orientation.

<Chessboard position="rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3 0 1" orientation="black" />
