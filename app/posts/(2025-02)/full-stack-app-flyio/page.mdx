Alright, let's build a full-stack application and deploy it with Fly.io.

We'll use the following technologies:

- TanStack Start for the frontend, including:
  - TanStack Router for routing
  - TanStack Query for data fetching
  - TanStack Form for form handling
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Fly.io for deployment

<Steps>
## Setup the project

```bash npm2yarn
npx create-tsrouter-app@latest --add-ons
```


With the `--add-ons` flag, the CLI will ask us which add-ons we want to add to the project.
Choose the ones that you think are relevant to your project.

## Prepare it for the Fly.io deployment

Head over to `app.config.ts` and add the following line:

```typescript filename="app.config.ts" {16-18}
import { defineConfig } from '@tanstack/react-start/config'
import viteTsConfigPaths from 'vite-tsconfig-paths'

export default defineConfig({
  tsr: {
    appDirectory: 'src',
  },
  vite: {
    plugins: [
      // this is the plugin that enables path aliases
      viteTsConfigPaths({
        projects: ['./tsconfig.json'],
      }),
    ],
  },
 server: {
   preset: 'node-server', // <=== add this
 }
})
```

Create a `Dockerfile` in the root of the project:

```dockerfile filename="Dockerfile"
FROM node:20-slim as base

# Install dependencies only when needed
FROM base AS deps
WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies based on the preferred package manager
COPY package.json pnpm-lock.yaml* ./
RUN npm install -g pnpm && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile

# Rebuild the source code only when needed
FROM base AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=deps /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY . .

# Install pnpm in the builder stage
RUN npm install -g pnpm

# Build the application
RUN pnpm build

# Production image, copy all the files and run the server
FROM node:20-slim AS runner
WORKDIR /app

ENV NODE_ENV=production

# Create a non-root user
RUN addgroup --system --gid 1001 nodejs && \
    adduser --system --uid 1001 nodejs

# THIS IS OPTIONAL, ONLY IF YOU NEED ACCESS TO THE FILE-SYSTEM
# Create directory for writable files with proper permissions
RUN mkdir -p /app/data && \
    chown -R nodejs:nodejs /app/data

# Copy only necessary files
COPY --from=builder /app/.output ./.output

# Expose the port the app will run on
EXPOSE 3000

USER nodejs

# Start the Node.js server
CMD ["node", ".output/server/index.mjs"]
```

And add a `fly.toml` file in the root of the project as well (with your own `app` and `primary_region` settings):

```toml filename="fly.toml" {3-4}
# See https://fly.io/docs/reference/configuration/ for information about how to use this file.

app = 'tanstack-react-app' # Replace with your app name
primary_region = 'lhr' # Replace with your preferred region

[build]
  dockerfile = 'Dockerfile'

[env]
  PORT = '3000'

[processes]
  app = 'node .output/server/index.mjs'

[http_service]
  internal_port = 3000
  force_https = true
  auto_stop_machines = 'stop'
  auto_start_machines = true
  min_machines_running = 0
  processes = ['app']

[[vm]]
  memory = '1gb'
  cpu_kind = 'shared'
  cpus = 1
```

## Deploy the app

You're ready to go. Let's deploy the app with:

<Tabs items={['First run', 'Subsequent runs']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```bash
    fly launch
    # You might need to run `fly auth login` first
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```bash
    fly deploy
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

## That's a wrap

Congrats! You've just deployed a full-stack application with Fly.io.
