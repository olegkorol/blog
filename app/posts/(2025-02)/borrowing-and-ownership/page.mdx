How Borrowing and Ownership works in Rust:

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");  // s comes into scope
    let s2 = gives_ownership();

    let a_string = String::from("hello");
    let s3 = takes_and_gives_back(a_string);

    println!("[main s] {s}");
    println!("[main s2] {s2}");
    println!("[main s3] {s3}");

    borrows(&s); // s's value moves into the function...
                 // ... and so is no longer valid here

    println!("[main s] {s}");

    takes_ownership(s);
    
    let x = 5; // x comes into scope

    makes_copy(x); // x would move into the function,
                   // but i32 is Copy, so it's okay to still
                   // use x afterward

} // Here, x goes out of scope, then s. But because s's value was moved, nothing
  // special happens.

fn borrows(some_string: &String) { // some_string comes into scope, as a borrow
    println!("[borrows] {some_string}");
} // Here, some_string goes out of scope and `drop` is called. The backing
  // memory is freed.

fn takes_ownership(some_string: String) { // some_string comes into scope
    println!("[takes_ownership] {some_string}");
} // Here, some_string goes out of scope and `drop` is called. The backing
  // memory is freed.

fn gives_ownership() -> String {
    let some_string = String::from("world"); // some_string comes into scope
    some_string // some_string is returned and moves out to the calling function
}

fn takes_and_gives_back(a_string: String) -> String { // a_string comes into scope
    println!("[takes_and_gives_back] {a_string}");
    a_string // a_string is returned and moves out to the calling function
}

fn makes_copy(some_integer: i32) { // some_integer comes into scope
    println!("[makes_copy] {some_integer}");
} // Here, some_integer goes out of scope. Nothing special happens.
