  Authenticating with a token is not supported anymore from CI/CD pipelines.
  Hence, we use `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` in this guide.

  > Authenticating with `--token` is deprecated and will be removed in a future major version of `firebase-tools`. Instead, use a service account key with `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to deploy your Firebase project with GitHub Actions.

You'll need to:
1. Create a service account
2. Create a service account key
3. Create a GitHub secret
4. Adapt GitHub Actions workflow

<Steps>
## Create service account

In order to create a service account key, we need to create a new SA in GCP's IAM.
`Firebase Develop Admin` alone doesn't seem to suffice, so we need these 4 roles roles:
- Firebase Develop Admin
- Cloud Functions Admin
- Artifact Registry Administrator
- Cloud Scheduler Admin
- Eventarc Admin

After this, we need to go to the AppEngine default service account (`<project_id>@appspot.gserviceaccount.com`), then `Permissions` and the click on `Grant Access`.
Add the newly created service account as principal, with the role `Service Account User`.

## Create service account key

To create a key for the service account we just created, select the service account under `IAM`, then go to `KEYS`. Click on `ADD KEY` and select `json`.
The key will be saved in a .json file. We'll use it in the next step.

## Create a GitHub secret

Now we want to create a secret in GitHub which stores the service account key that will be used in the GH Action.
Go to (repository) `Settings`, then `Secrets and variables -> Actions`. Create a new secret and paste the content of the json above in it. Save.

## Adapt the GitHub Actions workflow

Now we need to add `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` to the workflow:

```yml
# [...]
- name: Install firebase tools
  run: sudo npm i -g firebase-tools

- name: Write GCP Service Account from env vars to file
  env: GH_ACTIONS_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_MASTER: ${{ secrets.GH_ACTIONS_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_MASTER }}
  run: echo $GH_ACTIONS_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_MASTER >   $HOME/serviceAccount.json

- name: Install Dependencies
  run: cd functions && npm i

- name: Lint, Build & Deploy
  run: |
    export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=$HOME/serviceAccount.json
    cd functions
    npm run deploy-master --json
# [...]
```
</Steps>
