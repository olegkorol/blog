Here's a step-by-step guide on how to deploy your Next.js app to Deno Deploy.

<Steps>
## Create a new Next.js app

```bash npm2yarn
npx create-next-app@latest
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Or use an existing Next.js project.
</Callout>

## Check your Deno installation

Make sure you have Deno installed:

```bash
deno --version
# deno should be >=2.0.0, if not run `deno upgrade`
# if the command was not found, head to https://deno.com/
```

You should be able to run the app locally in development mode:

```bash
deno run dev
```

## Build the app

Let's build the app:

```bash
deno run build
```

## Deno Deploy(ment)

You'll need `deployctl` to deploy to Deno Deploy:

```bash
# check if you have it installed
deployctl --version

# if not, you can install it with
deno install -gArf jsr:@deno/deployctl
```

Alright, let's actually deploy our Next.js app.

<Callout type="warning">
  The process differs slightly based on the version of Next.js you're using.

  Pick *one* of the commands below.
</Callout>


```bash
# For Next.js 15
deployctl deploy --include=.next --include=public jsr:@deno/nextjs-start/v15

# For Next.js 14
deployctl deploy --include=.next --include=public jsr:@deno/nextjs-start
```
</Steps>

That's it!

By the way, you'll see that a `deno.json` file is created in the root of the project.<br />
It will be used in the future to know where to deploy the app.

You can find the full example repo on [github.com/olegkorol/deno-nextjs](https://github.com/olegkorol/deno-nextjs).
