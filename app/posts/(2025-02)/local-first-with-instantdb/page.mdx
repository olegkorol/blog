InstantDB is, hands down, the quickest and easiest way I've found so far to build a local-first application.

In this post, I'll show you how to use InstantDB to build a blazing fast local-first application.

## Why InstantDB?

It is super easy and fast to get started with InstantDB.

They currently offer SDKs for React and React Native (as well as vanilla JS).

Follow the instructions [here](https://www.instantdb.com/docs). In 5 minutes, you'll have a working application.
